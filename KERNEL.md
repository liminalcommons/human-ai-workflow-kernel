# Kernel Ephemeral Text

## Overview: The Human-AI Workflow Kernel

Welcome to the core of the Human-AI Workflow system. This 'Kernel' isn't code in the traditional sense; it's the foundational set of **JSON Schemas** (`schemas/`) and **Configuration Patterns** (`configs/`) that enable structured, repeatable, and self-documenting workflows for generating various artifacts (like documentation, tests, or even code scaffolding).

The key principles are:

*   **Configuration over Code:** Define *what* needs to be generated and *how* using declarative JSON files, rather than writing imperative scripts for each artifact.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Content definition (`content-config`) is distinct from artifact assembly (`artifact-config`).
*   **Human-AI Collaboration Native:** The v3.0 schemas explicitly include fields (`generation_source`, `review_status`, `expected_source`, `review_required`, etc.) to manage and track the interaction between human team members and AI assistants within the workflow configuration itself.
*   **Extensibility:** Designed to be a minimal base that you can fork and extend for your specific needs.

## Extending the Kernel

To adapt this kernel for your own workflows:

1.  **Fork/Copy:** Start with this repository as your base.
2.  **Define Content:** Create new content configurations (e.g., in `configs/content/your-feature/`) based on `schemas/content-schema.json`. Define the elements (text, code snippets, test steps) needed for your target artifact.
3.  **Define Artifacts:** Create corresponding artifact configurations (e.g., in `configs/artifacts/your-feature/`) based on `schemas/artifact-schema.json`. Reference your content configs and specify the final output file(s) and format.
4.  **Leverage v3.0 Features:** Utilize the advanced fields in the v3.0 schemas for:
    *   **Detailed Input Sourcing:** Pull context from other files, configs, or requirements (`inputs.sources`).
    *   **Specific Generation Types:** Use `generation.patterns.type` like `template_fill` or `code_generation`.
    *   **Advanced Validation:** Define `lint` or `syntax` checks (`validation.rules`).
    *   **Dependency Tracking:** Link related artifacts (`dependencies`).
5.  **Implement Tooling (If Needed):** While the schemas define the *structure*, processing advanced v3.0 features (like specific generation types or validation) requires a **generation engine or external tooling** capable of interpreting them. This kernel focuses on the configuration structure, not the full implementation.

**Note:** For the complete, detailed specification of all available fields, properties, and their intended usage within the v3.0 schemas, please refer directly to the `_comment` fields within the `schemas/content-schema.json` and `schemas/artifact-schema.json` files.
